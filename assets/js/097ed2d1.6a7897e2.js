As physical AI and humanoid robotics advance, the quality and effectiveness of HRI become paramount, moving beyond mere functionality to encompass naturalness, safety, and societal integration.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"category/advanced/reinforcement-learning-in-robotics":{"id":"category/advanced/reinforcement-learning-in-robotics","title":"Reinforcement Learning in Robotics","description":"Reinforcement Learning (RL) has emerged as a powerful paradigm for training robots to perform complex tasks in dynamic and uncertain environments. Unlike traditional control methods that rely on explicit programming, RL allows robots to learn optimal behaviors through trial and error, by interacting with their environment and receiving feedback in the form of rewards. This chapter delves into the fundamental concepts of RL and its specific applications, challenges, and solutions within the field of robotics.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"category/fundamentals/ai-for-robotics":{"id":"category/fundamentals/ai-for-robotics","title":"ai-for-robotics","description":"AI for Robotics","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"category/fundamentals/robotics-basics":{"id":"category/fundamentals/robotics-basics","title":"robotics-basics","description":"This chapter introduces the fundamental concepts of robotics, covering its history, types, key components, and basic principles of motion and control.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"category/humanoid/control-systems":{"id":"category/humanoid/control-systems","title":"Control Systems in Humanoid Robotics","description":"Control systems are the brain and nervous system of humanoid robots, enabling them to perform complex actions, maintain balance, and interact safely with their environment.
