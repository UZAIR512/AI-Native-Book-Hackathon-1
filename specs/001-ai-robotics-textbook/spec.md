feature_name: Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Textbook
branch: 001-ai-robotics-textbook
created_at: 2025-11-30

summary:
  The goal of this feature is to create a complete AI-native textbook for the
  Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics course using Docusaurus, Spec-Kit Plus, and Claude Code.
  The textbook must include technical chapters, labs, code examples, and diagrams,
  and must integrate an AI-powered RAG chatbot that can answer questions from the
  book content and from selected text. The project must also support personalization,
  Urdu translation, and optional authentication-based features.

goals:
  - Produce a full textbook with 12–15 chapters on Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics.
  - Build the textbook using Docusaurus and deploy it to GitHub Pages.
  - Enable automated chapter generation and updates using Spec-Kit Plus and Claude Code.
  - Add an integrated RAG chatbot using OpenAI Agents/ChatKit, FastAPI, Neon Postgres, and Qdrant Cloud.
  - Support user-based personalization and Urdu translation for chapters.
  - Enable optional signup/signin via Better-Auth.
  - Allow reusable AI subagents for automation and bonus scoring.

user_scenarios:
  - A student opens the book and reads chapters with diagrams, code, and robotics labs.
  - A learner highlights text inside the book and asks the embedded chatbot questions.
  - A user clicks “Personalize this chapter” to receive content based on their background level.
  - A reader presses “Translate to Urdu” to view the same chapter in Urdu.
  - A user logs in using Better-Auth and their background data influences content adjustments.
  - An instructor uses the chatbot to fetch quick summaries or generate quizzes.
  - Advanced users view robotics code examples generated by specialized subagents.

functional_requirements:
  textbook_structure:
    - The system must generate a complete Docusaurus structure with chapters, sections, and assets.
    - The content must be created using Spec-Kit Plus templates.
    - Each chapter must include:
      - Introduction
      - Theory
      - Examples
      - Code samples (Python/JS)
      - Diagrams
      - Exercises
      - Quizzes
      - Lab Tasks

  chatbot_integration:
    - The chatbot must be embedded in the Docusaurus UI.
    - The chatbot must accept full queries or selected text as context.
    - The chatbot must use Qdrant Cloud as a vector store.
    - The backend must use FastAPI to serve embeddings and vector search.
    - The chatbot must rely on OpenAI Agents or ChatKit SDK.

  backend_services:
    - A FastAPI service must manage embeddings, chat sessions, and logging.
    - Neon Postgres must store user profiles, reading progress, and preferences.
    - A Qdrant Cloud cluster must store book embeddings.
    - Embeddings must be generated using OpenAI or similar provider.

  user_personalization:
    - A “Personalize this chapter” button must appear at the start of every chapter.
    - Personalization must adjust:
      - Difficulty level
      - Code complexity
      - Explanations
      - Lab depth
    - Personalization logic must use Claude Code subagents or OpenAI tools.

  urdu_translation:
    - A “Translate to Urdu” button must appear at the start of each chapter.
    - Entire chapter content must be transformed into Urdu.
    - Translation must be handled by an AI agent (Claude/OpenAI).

  authentication:
    - Signup/Signin must use Better-Auth.
    - Signup must ask:
      - Software experience
      - Hardware/robotics experience
      - Education background
    - Data must be stored in Neon Postgres.

  ai_subagents:
    - The project must define several specialized AI utilities, such as:
      - Chapter Summarizer Agent
      - Quiz Generator Agent
      - Robotics Code Generator Agent
      - Urdu Translation Agent
      - Personalization Engine Agent

non_functional_requirements:
  - Response times for 90% of chatbot queries must be under 1.5 seconds.
  - The system architecture must follow a clear modular design, enabling independent development and deployment of components without impacting others, as defined in `plan.md`.
  - Code must adhere to established linting rules (ESLint, Prettier for frontend; Flake8, Black for backend) and follow TypeScript best practices for frontend, and FastAPI best practices for backend.
  - Textbook content must be scientifically accurate, with a manual review process by the project owner/designated domain experts, and presented in a simplified manner suitable for learners with a foundational understanding of programming and mathematics.
  - Deployment to GitHub Pages (frontend) and Render/Fly.io/Vercel (backend) must achieve 99.9% uptime and allow for zero-downtime updates.

## Clarifications
### Session 2025-11-30
- Q: What is the process for content review by domain experts, and who will be responsible for this review? → A: The review process will be a manual step handled by the project owner/user, who will provide feedback on the AI-generated content. The domain experts are implicitly the project owner or individuals they designate.

entities:
  - Chapter
  - Section
  - Quiz
  - Exercise
  - Lab Task
  - User Profile
  - User Preferences
  - Embedding Vector
  - Chat Session
  - Personalization Context

success_criteria:
  - The book renders correctly on GitHub Pages.
