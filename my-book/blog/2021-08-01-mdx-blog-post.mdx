Blog posts in Docusaurus are extremely powerful — especially because they support full **MDX**, letting you mix Markdown and React components inside a single article.

This post demonstrates how I’m using **MDX**, **interactive elements**, and **custom components** in my AI-Native textbook for the Panaversity Hackathon.

:::tip ✨ MDX Superpower
MDX lets you write content like normal Markdown **while embedding live React components** inside your post.

This makes your blog interactive, dynamic, and perfect for technical demos.

## 🚀 Why MDX Matters in the Hackathon

Since the final deliverable is an AI-native technical textbook, having MDX support allows:

- Interactive examples inside chapters  
- Live UI elements for AI features  
- Buttons for personalization + Urdu translation  
- Custom JSX blocks for explanations  
- React-based visualizations  

MDX turns your textbook into an **interactive learning platform**, not just a static document.

## 🎮 Interactive Example: React Button

Below is a simple demo showing how React components work directly inside a blog post.

```jsx
<button onClick={() => alert('You clicked a React-powered MDX button!')}>
  Click me!
</button>
