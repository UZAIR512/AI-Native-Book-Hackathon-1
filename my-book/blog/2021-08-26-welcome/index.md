Welcome to the blog documenting my journey in the **Panaversity Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Hackathon**!  
This blog is powered by the Docusaurus **Blog Plugin**, which makes it incredibly simple to publish posts, showcase progress, share updates, and integrate interactive MDX-powered content.

## 🚀 Getting Started with the Blog

Setting up a blog in Docusaurus is easy — you just add Markdown or MDX files inside the `blog` directory.

Each post can include:

- A `slug` for clean URLs  
- Authors from `authors.yaml`  
- Tags for categorization and filtering  
- MDX components for interactivity  
- Images stored next to the post folder  

For example, your blog post structure can look like:

- `2021-08-26-welcome.md`
- `2021-08-26-welcome/index.md`  
- With images stored in the same folder (like the one below)

## 🧠 Why This Blog Exists

Throughout the hackathon, I’m using this space to document:

- My progress building an **AI-native textbook**
- Integrating a **RAG-based AI chatbot**
- Experiments with **Claude Code** & **Spec-Kit Plus**
- Personalization features & Urdu translation buttons
- Docusaurus tips, MDX tricks, and integrations  

This will help me track my development journey and share insights with others following along.

## 🏷️ Tags & Metadata

Docusaurus supports tags for smart filtering and organization.  
You can define your tags in the `tags.yml` file, and assign them to posts like this one.

## ❌ Don’t Want a Blog?

If you prefer a docs-only textbook:  
Just delete the entire `/blog` directory and set `blog: false` inside your Docusaurus config.
