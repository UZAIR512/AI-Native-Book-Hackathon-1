The future of learning is shifting toward **AI-native education**, where textbooks, courses, and platforms are powered by intelligent agents. This blog marks the beginning of my journey in the **Panaversity Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Hackathon** — a challenge designed to push the boundaries of how we create, publish, and interact with technical knowledge.

Over the next few days, I’ll be building a complete **AI-generated textbook** using Spec-Kit Plus and Claude Code, deploying it with **Docusaurus**, and integrating a fully functional **RAG-powered chatbot** that can answer questions from the book in real time.

Some major goals of this project include:

- Building a polished AI-native textbook  
- Deploying it to GitHub Pages  
- Adding a RAG chatbot using OpenAI Agents, FastAPI, Qdrant, and NeonDB  
- Enabling personalized and Urdu-translated chapters  
- Exploring multi-agent workflows and reusable intelligence  

This blog will document my progress, challenges, learnings, and the evolution of the project as I move forward.  
**Stay tuned — big things are coming! 🚀**
